# CreditCardDefaulter

The Credit Card Defaulter Prediction Model is a machine learning project developed to predict whether a credit card user is likely to default on their payments. The model utilizes Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree algorithms to make accurate predictions. This project contains the code for building, training, and evaluating the model, along with visualizations of the evaluation metrics.


Key Features
Model Comparison: The project compares the performance of three popular machine learning algorithms - Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree - for credit card defaulter prediction. Each algorithm is trained and evaluated using various evaluation metrics.

Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance is assessed using evaluation metrics such as F1 score, Confusion Matrix, and Accuracy Score. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and ability to correctly classify defaulters and non-defaulters.

Graphical Representation: The project includes graphical representations of the defaulter vs. non-defaulter predictions. This visual representation allows for easier understanding and interpretation of the model's performance.
